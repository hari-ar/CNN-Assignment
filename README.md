## General Information
- In this assignment, we have to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

  # Problem Statement
    To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
 

# Business Goal 

 To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
 
## Conclusions
- The model built has a training accuracy of around 90% and validation accuracy of around 70%.
